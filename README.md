# 👋 Hi, I’m Eslam Elreedy

**AI / ML Engineer | NLP & LLM Specialist | AI Instructor**

I build **end-to-end AI systems** that survive real-world data, production constraints, and actual users — with a strong focus on **NLP, LLMs, healthcare AI, and data quality**.

I have hands-on experience designing, training, fine-tuning, deploying, and monitoring ML & LLM-based systems.  
Alongside industry work, I teach AI and help learners move from *models* to *systems*.
